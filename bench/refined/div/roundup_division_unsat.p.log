% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
minus(z(), Y) = z()
minus(X, z()) = X
minus(s(X), s(Y)) = minus(X, Y)
div(z(), s(Y)) = z()
div(s(X), s(Y)) = s(div(minus(X, Y), s(Y)))
goal:
div(s(z()), s(s(z()))) != s(z())
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that div(s(z()), s(s(z()))) = s(z()) (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: minus(z(), X0) -> z().
Proof: Axiom.

3: div(z(), s(X0)) -> z().
Proof: Axiom.

4: div(s(X1), s(X0)) <- s(div(minus(X1, X0), s(X0))).
Proof: Axiom.

6: div(s(z()), s(X2)) -> s(div(z(), s(X2))).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 4 and 0 with superposition s(div(minus(z(), X2), s(X2))).

13: div(s(z()), s(X2)) -> s(z()).
Proof: Rewrite equation 6,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [3].

14: div(s(z()), s(s(z()))) = s(z()).
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [13]
               rhs with equations [].
