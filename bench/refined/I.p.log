% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
a(a(a(s(), X), Y), Z) = a(a(X, Z), a(Y, Z))
a(a(k(), X), Y) = X
goal:
a(a(a(s(), k()), k()), x()) != x()
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that a(a(a(s(), k()), k()), x()) = x() (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: a(a(a(s(), X0), X1), X2) = a(a(X0, X2), a(X1, X2)).
Proof: Axiom.

1: a(a(k(), X0), X1) -> X0.
Proof: Axiom.

2: a(a(a(s(), k()), X1), X3) -> X3.
Proof: A critical pair between equations 0 and 1 with superposition a(a(k(), X3), a(X1, X3)).

10: a(a(a(s(), k()), k()), x()) = x().
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [2]
               rhs with equations [].
