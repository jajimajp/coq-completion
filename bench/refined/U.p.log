% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
a(a(a(s(), X), Y), Z) = a(a(X, Z), a(Y, Z))
a(a(k(), X), Y) = X
a(i(), X) = X
goal:
a(a(a(a(s(), a(k(), a(s(), i()))), a(a(s(), i()), i())), x()), y()) != a(y(), a(a(x(), x()), y()))
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that a(a(a(a(s(), a(k(), a(s(), i()))), a(a(s(), i()), i())), x()), y()) = a(y(), a(a(x(), x()), y())) (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: a(a(a(s(), X0), X1), X2) = a(a(X0, X2), a(X1, X2)).
Proof: Axiom.

1: a(a(k(), X0), X1) -> X0.
Proof: Axiom.

2: a(i(), X0) -> X0.
Proof: Axiom.

5: a(a(a(s(), i()), X1), X3) = a(X3, a(X1, X3)).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 0 and 2 with superposition a(a(i(), X3), a(X1, X3)).

7: a(a(a(s(), a(k(), X3)), X1), X4) -> a(X3, a(X1, X4)).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 0 and 1 with superposition a(a(a(k(), X3), X4), a(X1, X4)).

13: a(a(a(s(), i()), i()), X4) = a(X4, X4).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 5 and 2 with superposition a(X4, a(i(), X4)).

26: a(a(a(a(s(), a(k(), a(s(), i()))), a(a(s(), i()), i())), x()), y()) = a(y(), a(a(x(), x()), y())).
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [7]
               rhs with equations [13,5].
