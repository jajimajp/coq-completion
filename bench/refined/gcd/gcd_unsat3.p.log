% SZS status Unsatisfiable

original problem:
axioms:
le(z(), Y) = true()
le(s(X), z()) = false()
le(s(X), s(Y)) = le(X, Y)
minus(X, z()) = X
minus(s(X), s(Y)) = minus(X, Y)
gcd(z(), Y) = Y
gcd(s(X), z()) = s(X)
gcd(s(X), s(Y)) = if_gcd(le(Y, X), s(X), s(Y))
if_gcd(true(), s(X), s(Y)) = gcd(minus(X, Y), s(Y))
if_gcd(false(), s(X), s(Y)) = gcd(minus(Y, X), s(X))
goal:
gcd(s(s(z())), s(z())) != s(z())
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that gcd(s(s(z())), s(z())) = s(z()) (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: le(z(), X0) -> true().
Proof: Axiom.

3: minus(X1, z()) -> X1.
Proof: Axiom.

5: gcd(z(), X0) -> X0.

7: gcd(s(X1), s(X0)) <- if_gcd(le(X0, X1), s(X1), s(X0)).

8: if_gcd(true(), s(X1), s(X0)) <- gcd(minus(X1, X0), s(X0)).
Proof: Axiom.

9: if_gcd(false(), s(X1), s(X0)) <- gcd(minus(X0, X1), s(X1)).

10: if_gcd(true(), s(X1), s(X0)) <- if_gcd(false(), s(X0), s(X1)).
Proof: Rewrite equation 8,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [9].

11: if_gcd(true(), s(X0), s(X1)) <- gcd(minus(X0, X1), s(X1)).

               lhs with equations [10]
               rhs with equations [].

12: if_gcd(true(), s(X2), s(z())) <- gcd(X2, s(z())).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 11 and 3 with superposition gcd(minus(X2, z()), s(z())).

15: if_gcd(false(), s(z()), s(X2)) <- gcd(X2, s(z())).
Proof: Rewrite equation 12,
               lhs with equations [10]
               rhs with equations [].

17: if_gcd(false(), s(z()), s(z())) -> s(z()).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 15 and 5 with superposition gcd(z(), s(z())).

18: gcd(s(X2), s(z())) -> if_gcd(true(), s(X2), s(z())).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 7 and 0 with superposition if_gcd(le(z(), X2), s(X2), s(z())).

26: if_gcd(true(), s(s(X2)), s(z())) -> if_gcd(true(), s(X2), s(z())).

               lhs with equations [15,10]
               rhs with equations [].

               lhs with equations [10]
               rhs with equations [].

29: if_gcd(true(), s(X2), s(z())) <- gcd(X2, s(z())).
Proof: Rewrite equation 15,
               lhs with equations [10]
               rhs with equations [].

31: gcd(s(s(z())), s(z())) = s(z()).
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [29,26,26,27]
               rhs with equations [].
