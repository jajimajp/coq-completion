% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
f(X, e()) = X
f(X, i(X)) = e()
f(f(X, Y), Z) = f(X, f(Y, Z))
goal:
f(i(X), X) != e()
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that f(i(c1()), c1()) = e() (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: f(X0, e()) -> X0.
Proof: Axiom.

1: f(X0, i(X0)) -> e().
Proof: Axiom.

2: f(f(X0, X1), X2) -> f(X0, f(X1, X2)).
Proof: Axiom.

3: f(X3, f(e(), X2)) -> f(X3, X2).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 2 and 0 with superposition f(f(X3, e()), X2).

5: f(X3, f(i(X3), X2)) -> f(e(), X2).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 2 and 1 with superposition f(f(X3, i(X3)), X2).

7: f(e(), i(i(X3))) -> f(X3, e()).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 5 and 1 with superposition f(X3, f(i(X3), i(i(X3)))).

22: f(e(), i(i(X3))) -> X3.
Proof: Rewrite equation 7,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [0].

27: f(X3, i(i(X4))) -> f(X3, X4).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 3 and 22 with superposition f(X3, f(e(), i(i(X4)))).

45: f(i(X4), X4) -> e().
Proof: A critical pair between equations 27 and 1 with superposition f(i(X4), i(i(X4))).

56: f(i(c1()), c1()) = e().
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [45]
               rhs with equations [].
