% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
f(X, e()) = X
f(X, i(X)) = e()
f(f(X, Y), Z) = f(X, f(Y, Z))
goal:
f(e(), X) != X
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that f(e(), c1()) = c1() (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: f(X0, e()) -> X0.
Proof: Axiom.

1: f(X0, i(X0)) -> e().
Proof: Axiom.

2: f(f(X0, X1), X2) -> f(X0, f(X1, X2)).
Proof: Axiom.

3: f(X3, f(e(), X2)) -> f(X3, X2).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 2 and 0 with superposition f(f(X3, e()), X2).

4: e() <- f(X3, f(X4, i(f(X3, X4)))).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 1 and 2 with superposition f(f(X3, X4), i(f(X3, X4))).

5: f(X3, f(i(X3), X2)) -> f(e(), X2).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 2 and 1 with superposition f(f(X3, i(X3)), X2).

11: f(e(), f(X6, i(f(i(X3), X6)))) -> f(X3, e()).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 5 and 4 with superposition f(X3, f(i(X3), f(X6, i(f(i(X3), X6))))).

18: f(e(), f(X6, i(f(i(X3), X6)))) -> X3.
Proof: Rewrite equation 11,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [0].

34: X3 <- f(e(), f(f(e(), X8), i(f(i(X3), X8)))).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 18 and 3 with superposition f(e(), f(f(e(), X8), i(f(i(X3), f(e(), X8))))).

37: X3 <- f(e(), X3).
Proof: Rewrite equation 34,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [2,18].

43: f(e(), c1()) = c1().
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [37]
               rhs with equations [].
