% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
f(X, e()) = X
f(X, i(X)) = e()
f(f(X, Y), Z) = f(X, f(Y, Z))
goal:
i(e()) != e()
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that i(e()) = e() (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: f(X0, e()) -> X0.
Proof: Axiom.

1: f(X0, i(X0)) -> e().
Proof: Axiom.

2: f(f(X0, X1), X2) -> f(X0, f(X1, X2)).
Proof: Axiom.

3: f(X3, f(e(), X2)) -> f(X3, X2).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 2 and 0 with superposition f(f(X3, e()), X2).

4: e() <- f(X3, f(X4, i(f(X3, X4)))).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 1 and 2 with superposition f(f(X3, X4), i(f(X3, X4))).

5: f(X3, f(i(X3), X2)) -> f(e(), X2).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 2 and 1 with superposition f(f(X3, i(X3)), X2).

8: f(X3, f(i(e()), X5)) -> f(X3, f(e(), X5)).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 3 and 5 with superposition f(X3, f(e(), f(i(e()), X5))).

21: f(X3, f(i(e()), X5)) -> f(X3, X5).
Proof: Rewrite equation 8,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [3].

35: f(X3, f(X7, i(f(i(e()), X7)))) -> f(X3, e()).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 21 and 4 with superposition f(X3, f(i(e()), f(X7, i(f(i(e()), X7))))).

36: f(X3, f(X7, i(f(i(e()), X7)))) -> X3.
Proof: Rewrite equation 35,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [0].

43: i(e()) -> e().
Proof: A critical pair between equations 36 and 4 with superposition f(i(e()), f(X9, i(f(i(e()), X9)))).

56: i(e()) = e().
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [43]
               rhs with equations [].
