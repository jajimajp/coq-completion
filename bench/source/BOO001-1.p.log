% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
multiply(multiply(V, W, X), Y, multiply(V, W, Z)) = multiply(V, W, multiply(X, Y, Z))
multiply(Y, X, X) = X
multiply(X, X, Y) = X
multiply(inverse(Y), Y, X) = X
multiply(X, Y, inverse(Y)) = X
goal:
inverse(inverse(a())) != a()
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that inverse(inverse(a())) = a() (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: multiply(multiply(X0, X1, X2), X3, multiply(X0, X1, X4)) -> multiply(X0, X1, multiply(X2, X3, X4)).
Proof: Axiom.

1: multiply(X3, X2, X2) -> X2.
Proof: Axiom.

2: multiply(X2, X2, X3) -> X2.
Proof: Axiom.

3: multiply(inverse(X3), X3, X2) -> X2.
Proof: Axiom.

4: multiply(X2, X3, inverse(X3)) -> X2.
Proof: Axiom.

12: multiply(X5, X6, multiply(inverse(X6), X3, X4)) = multiply(X5, X3, multiply(X5, X6, X4)).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 0 and 4 with superposition multiply(multiply(X5, X6, inverse(X6)), X3, multiply(X5, X6, X4)).

22: multiply(X7, X8, multiply(inverse(X8), X3, X8)) = multiply(X7, X3, X8).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 12 and 1 with superposition multiply(X7, X3, multiply(X7, X8, X8)).

36: multiply(X7, inverse(X10), X10) -> multiply(X7, X10, inverse(X10)).
Proof: A critical pair between equations 22 and 2 with superposition multiply(X7, X10, multiply(inverse(X10), inverse(X10), X10)).

42: multiply(X7, inverse(X10), X10) -> X7.
Proof: Rewrite equation 36,
               lhs with equations []
               rhs with equations [4].

45: inverse(inverse(X12)) -> X12.
Proof: A critical pair between equations 42 and 3 with superposition multiply(inverse(inverse(X12)), inverse(X12), X12).

59: inverse(inverse(a())) = a().
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [45]
               rhs with equations [].
