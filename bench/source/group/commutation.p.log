% SZS status Satisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
f(X, e()) = X
f(X, i(X)) = e()
f(f(X, Y), Z) = f(X, f(Y, Z))
goal:
f(a(), b()) != f(b(), a())
To show the satisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that f(a(), b()) = f(b(), a()) is not valid under the following axioms:
The new axioms admits the following ground-complete ordered rewrite system:
LPO with precedence: b > a > i > f > e
ES:
56: f(i(X7), f(X7, X2)) -> X2
37: f(e(), X3) -> X3
40: f(X3, f(i(X3), X2)) -> X2
2: f(f(X0, X1), X2) -> f(X0, f(X1, X2))
1: f(X0, i(X0)) -> e()
0: f(X0, e()) -> X0
43: i(e()) -> e()
45: f(i(X4), X4) -> e()
55: i(i(X6)) -> X6
71: i(f(X10, X9)) -> f(i(X9), i(X10))

f(a(), b()) = f(b(), a()) is not joinable.
So f(a(), b()) = f(b(), a()) is not valid.
