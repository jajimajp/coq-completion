% SZS status Unsatisfiable
% SZS output start Proof
original problem:
axioms:
f(a()) = b()
f(c()) = d()
a() = c()
goal:
f(a()) != d()
To show the unsatisfiability of the original goal,
it suffices to show that f(a()) = d() (skolemized goal) is valid under the axioms.
Here is an equational proof:
0: f(a()) -> b().
Proof: Axiom.

1: f(c()) <- d().
Proof: Axiom.

2: a() <- c().
Proof: Axiom.

3: b() <- d().
Proof: Rewrite equation 1,
               lhs with equations [2,0]
               rhs with equations [].

4: f(a()) = d().
Proof: Rewrite lhs with equations [0]
               rhs with equations [3].
